## Project Description

Many countries, especially low and middle income countries, are facing limited vaccination supply and fearing the increasingly wide-spread emergence of faster-spreading SARS-CoV-2 virus variants.

The majority of available vaccines require two immunization shots to provide maximum protection. Yet, the immunological response to the first (''prime'') injection may already  provide a substantial degree of protection against infection. Thus, it may be more effective to vaccinate as many people as possible with only one shot, instead of administering a person a second (''boost'') shot. Such a strategic vaccination campaign may help to more effectively slow down the spread of SARS-CoV-2, thereby reducing fatalities and the risk of collapsing health care systems.

To help explore the conditions which make single-dose vaccination favourable over prime-boost administrations, we combine epidemiological modeling, random sampling techniques, and decision tree learning.

A schematic of prime-first and prime-boost vaccination campaigns and our SEIR model extension is shown below. Panels (a,b) show the evolution of the number of prime and prime-boost vaccianted individuals. Model compartments and transitions are shown in panel (c).

Vaccination-campaign-preference diagrams can be generated by running the scripts in ``model/vaccination_preference_diagrams``. A simple example that shows the evolution of different model compartments is stored in ``model/example``. If you are interested in generating input files for the decision tree analysis, please check the files in ``model/datasetA`` and ``model/datasetB``.
